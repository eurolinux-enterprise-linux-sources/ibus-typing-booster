# transliteration.

# Attention: when using the m17n input method “ur-phonetic” for Urdu
# the Eastern Arabic numerals ۱۲۳۴۵۶۷۸۹۰ cannot be typed because
# “ur-phonetic” produces these by transliterating 1234567890 and
# these cannot be added to the list of valid input characters because
# this would prevent selecting between the suggested candidates.
