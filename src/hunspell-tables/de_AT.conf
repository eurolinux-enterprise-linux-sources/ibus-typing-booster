# “m17n_mim_name” selects the default input method. Omit this key or
# set it to the the special value “NoIme” to use no input method
# by default. If a keyboard layout is available which has all
# needed characters, no input method is necessary and using
# the keyboard layout directly might be more convenient.

# values. “Display Name” is the text which should be presented to the
# user in the menu to select the input method, “Input Method” is the
# name of the input method as libtranslit needs it to load the input method.
# There is one special value “NoIme” for “Input Method”, this value
# means “Do not use any m17n transliteration at all, use the characters
# as they are produced by the keyboard layout directly without any
# transliteration.
