# There is one special value “NoIme” for “Input Method”, this value
# means “Do not use any m17n transliteration at all, use the characters
# as they are produced by the keyboard layout directly without any
# transliteration.
#
# Attention: using the simulated Azerty keyboard from m17n
# for French is probably not a good idea. Because the 0123456789
# keys need to be valid input keys then (for example '2' is transliterated to
# 'é'. But if the number keys are valid input chars, they cannot be used
# to select one of the suggested candidates anymore.
# So better set other_ime=False for French and only use the native
# keyboard.
